FDI Analysis (2000-2017)
Project Overview
This project analyzes Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) trends from 2000 to 2017. The objective is to identify key patterns, trends, and insights regarding FDI inflows, outflows, and sectoral contributions. This analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and businesses looking to understand the dynamics of FDI during this period.

Data Sources
FDI Data (2000-2017): Collected from reliable databases such as World Bank and UNCTAD.
Supplementary Data: Economic indicators, exchange rates, and GDP data were used to contextualize FDI trends.
Project Structure
data/: Contains raw and cleaned data files.
scripts/: Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and generating reports, created and run using Replit.
visualizations/: Power BI dashboards and visualizations.
reports/: Contains the final analysis report, including visualizations and key findings.
excel_observations/: Contains Excel files used for observing and exploring the data in CSV format.
Methodology
Data Collection: Gathered FDI data from multiple reliable sources and supplementary economic indicators.
Data Cleaning: Cleaned the data using Python Pandas to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA using Python scripts in Replit to identify trends, outliers, and patterns in FDI inflows and outflows.
Sectoral Analysis: Analyzed FDI contributions across various sectors to understand which sectors attracted the most investment.
Visualization: Created interactive dashboards and visualizations in Power BI to present the findings effectively.
Observation: Used Excel to observe and explore the CSV data before conducting the full analysis.
Key Findings
